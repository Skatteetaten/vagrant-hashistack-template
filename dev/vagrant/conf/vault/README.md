# Vault configuration
You may add any `.hcl` or `.json` -files to this directory in order to change or override the configuration.
Any valid [vault configuration](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/configuration) added to this directory will append to the configuration, in lexical order.
It means that by prefixing a filename with `00` (e.g. `00-override.hcl`), it will be read first and using `99` (e.g. `99-override.hcl`) it will be read last.

An example file is provided in [template_example/dev/vagrant/conf/vault](https://github.com/fredrikhgrelland/vagrant-hashistack-template/tree/master/template_example/dev/vagrant/conf/vault).
